Current version: 18.0<br/>

## Introduction
Heishamon hardware is created by Egyras. AWESOME job! <br/>
https://www.tindie.com/stores/thehognl/ <br/>
It is able to communicate with a range of Panasonic Heatpumps. 
- Heishamon receives information from the Panasonic heat pump and sends it to a MQTT-broker.  
- Heishamon receives commands from the MQTT-broker and sends it to the Panasonic heatpump. 

There are multiple options to connect to the heishamon and control your heatpump.<br/>
* []() 1: MQTT > Home Assistant
* []() 2: MQTT > OpenHab
* []() 3: MQTT > Domoticz
* []() 4: MQTT > Node Red
* []() 5: MQTT > ... any other 

All of the above options are ways to interact with the HP. (And all are good if your happy with it)<br/>
I have chosen Node Red (=NR). I already use a lot of NR functionality/automations combined with HomeAssistant. In many cases NR is the controller and HomeAssistant (=HA) is just the graphical front. This CAN be different if you want, as HA is also able to send/receive MQTT messages.  

(Just to emphasize; because of the awesome design choice of Heishamon, it presents everything in the MQTT standard, and thatâ€™s why it is able to interact with ANY software that can handle it.)<br/>
BUT...I choose the NR option because if I update or restart HA, the controller and automations just continue. 
<br/>
I have chosen option 4 in the list above. In this GIT you can find NR functions to control the Panasonic.

**What do I need to make use of this flow?**<br/>
1: The heishamon module working with your heatpump.<br/>
2: A functional MQTT broker. (Mosquitto/HiveMQ/etc)<br/>
3: A functional NodeRed instance. <br/>
4: Heatpump in DIRECT mode. <br/>
 
<br/>
1: Obviously, you need the heishamon module connected to your heatpump and have it functional. Without this module, you can stop reading. ðŸ˜„ See this site to get one: https://www.tindie.com/stores/thehognl/ <br/><br/>
2: You can use any broker that is 24/7 available. You can install it on any system, as long as the heishamon and the broker can communicate with eachother.<br/>
<br/>
3: You can install node red on a lot of devices. It can be directly on Linux or a device like Raspberry Pi. You can also run it in a container (self hosted) or within Home Assistant (add-on). For all options see: https://nodered.org/ <br/> All of these options are good, as long as the Node Red application can communicate with the broker and the Node Red instance has persistant storage enabled.<br/>
The NodeRed flow is stand-alone so: You do not require a database. You do not require HomeAssistant.<br/><br/>
4: This Node Red flow generates and controls the setpoint for the T outlet (Ta). This means you need to put your pump in DIRECT mode on the thermostat itself. 
From within Heishamon, TOP76, will inform you if you currently are in WAR mode or DIRECT mode. <br/>(0=WAR, 1=DIRECT)

## Requirements on the Node Red install:
A - Persistent data folder.

B - Adjust settings.js.

C - Required Node Red libraries/pallets

But first; Why?<br/>
I found that after reboot of node red, the logic did not have all variables populated yet. This caused the system not to start automatically where it left off before reboot. <br/>
To be honest, this does not present a major problem to me, but it will reduce the overall WAF significantly when I donâ€™t notice something like this in time. So, I had to look for a solution to make the programmed setpoints, and all other variables, stick. This is how I achieved that. (Maybe there are better options, feel free to help me on this :) )

### A - Data folder
Make sure Node Red is installed with persistent local volume available. <br/>
If you have Node Red running directly inside Linux (not using docker) or on a RPI, this is already okay and you don't need to create a data folder.
If you have Node Red running in a docker container, make sure you install with this parameter:
```
-v FOLDER:/data
```
Here you can choose the name "FOLDER" yourself which will be the local storage folder of NR.<br/>

If you are node red withing Home Assistand, which is a HA controlled container, follow these instructions:
https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/tree/main/HomeAssistant
<br/>	
### B - Adjust settings.js
You need to change some settings in settings.js<br/>
Why? If you reboot node red, you will notice some of the variables are not populated yet. Setpoints we have programmed earlier are gone. To make them persistent after reboots, you have to enable the local storage option. Below I have set the flush interval (write to disk) to 300s. 

In a (proxmox) docker install, you can find this settings.js file in:
```
/var/lib/docker/volumes/FOLDER/_data
```
where 'FOLDER' is your own folder name chosen in part A. 

Search for contextStorage:
Put in the text as below:
```
contextStorage: {
	default: "memoryOnly",
	memoryOnly: { module: 'memory' },
	file: { module: 'localfilesystem', config: {flushInterval: '300'}, }
},
```
Reboot Node Red for the changes to load.<br/>

ATTENTION: <br/>
After you have done this, and you seem to have it operational, be sure to test if all settings *stick* after a reboot of Node Red. Things that should stick are: Virtual SP (Ta), Function toggles on the main page, Setpoints in WAR function/graph. Setpoints for RTC function/graph, Heat Pump power toggle on/off
If this is not the case for you, you either need to correct this in settings (like given above), or choose not to use this NR flow, or even accept manual action needed after power loss situations.

### C - Required Node Red libraries/pallets
To make use of the dashboard functionality, you need to install the dashboard library.<br/>
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard <br/>
The scheduler makes use of the moment lib.<br/>
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-moment <br/>
node-red-contrib-noop is used as well <br/>
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-noop <br/>
node-red-contrib-dashboard-bar-chart-data (from v13+)<br/>
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-dashboard-bar-chart-data <br/>

## How to install the NR flows
Dashboard: http://IP:1880/ui
Flows: http://IP:1880/#flow

* []() In NR, click on the hamburger icon (three horizontal stripes) in the top right corner
* []() Select Import
* []() Copy/past the content of the .JSON file from this GIT. (or select a file to upload and select the flow.json file offered here)
* []() Click on Import

Once imported, you probably need to adjust the settings of the MQTT server. <br/>
Click on the hamburger icon and then configuration nodes. Find the MQTT broker part, double click it and change to your settings.<br/>
![](https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/blob/main/images/dashboard3.png?raw=true)<br/>

Important >> After import and correcting the MQTT settings, you could want to connect two custom sensors for the functions to work as designed.<br/>
1: a good room temperature sensor<br/>
2: a custom outside temperature sensor<br/>
As explained by the image below, you CAN use the Panasonic sensors for this. To do this, in tab (1), WP Control, you only need to connect your custom sensor to the [CONNECT >> ..... ] nodes. The flows now automatically use the custom sensor when supplied. <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/blob/main/images/External%20sources2.png?raw=true" width=75%> <br/>
** Note 1: The Panasonic Room Thermostat is not very accurate which might cause bad temperature control. <br/>
** Note 2: The Outside temperature sensor on the Panasonic might be subject to heating up due to direct sunlight. This can also have a negative impact on the functions. Personally I use DarkSky sensor for outside temperature, but anything is possible.<br/>

## How to personalize or customize
It is advised to create a separate tab for your external sources. Any source available in Node Red can be conditioned and used as a sensor in the functions. If you do this in an 'personal tab', then it is likely easier to update later to newer versions. (no guarantees of course)<br/>

## How to create a backup of your current flow

<details>
There is no easy solution currently know by me to update only changed nodes or flows. <br/>
First: Create a backup of current version. Select all tabs by holding CTRL. Then in the right menu select Export > Download. <br/><br/>

![](https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/blob/main/images/Backup_animation1.gif) <br/>RightMouseClick on the GIF and select open in a new tab to see it full screen.<br/>
</details>


## How to update to a newer version
<details>	
Update to newer version:<br/>	
I found it is easiest to:<br/> 
1, remove the tabs, WP MQTT, WP Dash, WP Control, WP Solar, WP Scheduler completely<br/> 
2, remove all ui_base, ui_group and ui_tab references from the flows.<br/> 
	*Keep the MQTT (x.x.x.x) and Home Assistant references.<br/>
3, import new version<br/> 
4, correct setup, eg. MQTT server.<br/> 
5, re-connect your personalizationâ€™s.<br/> 
	*Not nessesary if you used a WP_Personal tab (see FAQ.md).<br/>
If there are better ideas about this, please inform me. <br/> <br/>

<details>
This is currently the first page of the dashboard. From here, you can enable each function separate but you can ALSO use WAR + RTC or WAR + SS together. It does not matter. they add on top of each other. You can use multiple combinations. Virtual SP + RTC function. Or WAR + RTC functions or only set a Virtual SP. 

Set the 'Virtual SP'. This resembles the Ta in direct mode. <br/>
If you do not enable any other function, the Virtual SP will be the actual target temperature.<br/>
But, if you enable the WAR function, this will override the virtual SP. <br/>
If you enable the RTC function, the virtual SP or WAR result will be corrected by the RTC function. <br/>
![](https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/blob/main/images/Home1.png?raw=true)
<br/>
## Function 1: WAR (weather dependent temperature control)
The target water temperature is influenced by the outside temperature. When it gets colder, the temperature of the water should increase. I have built a GUI including a graph to create a temperature profile.
![](https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/blob/main/images/WAR2.png?raw=true)

## Function 2: RTC (RoomTemperatureControl)
This function adjusts the SP of the water depending on the room temperature. <br/>
When the temperature in a room gets too high, it will add a "-1" to the setpoint of the water temperature. <br/>
Through the GUI, you can set the room target temperature. And you can set the limits when you want to increase or decrease the SP by 1, 2 or 3 degrees.<br/>
A recent addition is the possibility to have the pump shut down when above the fourth limit. If you do not set a value, it will not turn off. If you have and dont want this function anymore. set the on/off values to extremes so they are never reached.<br/>
Note that when you let the HP shut down above a threshold, you need to look at your Scheduled actions. If you do want the scheduler to operate, use the override toggle here. <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/blob/main/images/rtc2.png?raw=true" width=60%>

## Function 3: SoftStart (EXPERIMENTAL!!)
This function is present but not advised to be used yet. I have not tested this well enough. Last time I tested it worked, but not stable resulting in early stops. This function still needs work.<br/>
![](https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/blob/main/images/SS.png?raw=true)

## Function 4: Solar
The aim of this function is to increase efficiency (and save cost) by utilizing solar energy as much as possible.
When there is solar energy in abundance, you can tell the heatpump to use that energy to heat up your DHW water tank. 
To determine if there is enough solar energy, you need any form of power measurement. This can be a P1 power meter, or a meter directly behind your panels.<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/blob/main/images/solar7.png?raw=true" width=80%>

## Scheduler
I have added an option to create 10x schedules (in dashboard) for:
- DHW runs
- Sterilization runs
- Quiet modes
- Operation modes
<br/>You can enable/disable a schedule, multiselect a day of the week, specify the time (hour + minute) and give the schedule a name.<br/>
In addition, the override toggle will allow you to start a planned action, even when the HeatPump is turned off at that time. If this toggle is disabled, a switched off heatpump will not do the scheduled task.<br/>

Q - I use the Node Red Addon in Home Assistant, how to go to the Node Red Gui for editing?
<details>
    Most users should visit via a browser: 'http://Your_NodeRed_IP:1880/ui'<br/>
    In my case this wasn't working, perhabs due to the use of the DuckDNS addon. <br/>
    Use something like 'https://your.duckdns.org:1880/endpoint/ui/' instead.<br/>
</details>
    
Q - Can I use both WAR and RTC at the same time?
<details>
    Yes. If you have both enabled, the WAR function first calculates the SP (Setpoint) depending on outside temperature. Next the RTC function will correct that SP(war) depending on the roomtemperature. The only SP going to the heatpump will be SP at the end of all the calculations/corrections.
</details>

Q - If I switch off the Heatpomp via the Remote Controller will it disable the automation from the Node Red flow also?
<details>
    No, both will work seperatly. If you turn the Heatpump on via the Remote Controller, the pump will switch on.<br/>
    Keep in mind however that if the Node Red flow decides it time to adjust some settings it will act accordingly and overwrite settings.<br/>
</details>

Q - I know the function SOFTSTART is experimental, but can you explain what this function does?
<details>
    The idea behind this function is that when the compressor is just started, the frequency of the compressor goes up to 45+Hz. Well out of the efficient range. This is caused by the inner controller of the heatpump. When turned on, it 'wants' to see the impact of the compressor. It looks at the returning watertemperature for this. Only when the water temperature returning towards the heatpump is nearing the target temperature, it will start to lower the compressor frequency and get in a stable/efficient mode. Throttling... <br/>
This late throttling behaviour can be quiet energy consuming, it can cause the heat pump to generate too much heat at the start and turn off again. <br/><br/>
This SOFTSTART function, when enabled, looks at the moment when the compressor is on, and lower the setpoint to just above the temperature of the returning water. This will in theory cause the heatpump to start throttling down a lot quicker. 
<br/>This function can be usefull directly after defrost cycles when the pump starts again, or when the temperature difference between outside/inside is getting smaller. 
</details>

Q - Is there an overview and explanation of all settings from the dashboards?
<details>
    I will try to help Edterbak adding more HELP/INFO pages for all seprate dashboards, like at the moment you'll find on the "Function (Solar)"-dashboard.
</details>

Q - How do I add my Entities from Home Assistant like Livingroom temperature?
<details>
    In the Nope Red Gui (http://Your_NodeRed_IP:1880/ui) you will have to go to the [WP Control] tab;<br/>
    In the square "REQUIRED INPUTS FOR FUNCTIONS" you will have to add a node (left pane under Home Assistant) named "Events: state".<br/>
    You can drag and drop this in the square mentioned first.<br/>
    It will replace the "TOP33 - panasonic_heat_pump/main/Room_Thermostat_Temp"-node eventually, which you should disable if not using.<br/>
    Select the newly created node, then double click to open up the properties window;<br/>
    Give is a name of your choosings like 'LivingRoom_temperature'<br/>
    In the Entitie box you can try to find your sensor entitie (assuming you have already setup the MQTT settings earlier).<br/>
    Make sure that in the 'Output properties' you have a MSG.PAYLOAD = EVENT STATE<br/>
    Check the box 'output on connect' and make sure at the bottom this node is enabled.<br/>
    Finally press DONE to close the properties dialog and connect your node to the function node 'set.T_woonkamer_BT'<br/>

Q - How to use a dark theme in the dashboard?
 <details>
    In the Node Red Gui (http://Your_NodeRed_IP:1880/ui) press the top most right arrow-down sign and select dashboard;<br/>
    Now press the Theme-tab and pick your style.<br/>
    <img src="https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/blob/ce92e6c7e48323f48742035acb441fb9d3d76aba/images/ChangeTheme.png?raw=true" width=50%> <br/>
</details>

Q - How to update flow to latest version and keep my inputs, MQTT and Home Assistant settings?
 <details>
    Create a personal tab (WP Personal) and place your inputs here (P1, Temperature sensors)<br/>
    Give those inputs.sensors each an own [Link Out] node<br/>
    Connect those [Link Out] nodes to the already excisting [Link In] nodes by double clicking the [Link Out] node and select the corresponding one from the list.<br/>
     Some images to explain this:<br/>

All older changelog items are colapsed below. only the latest changelog will always be shown.
<details>
[2021-11-09] (v1) First release. Current versions of the function seem rough. I will polish it at a later time and update here. The Flows do contain comments to clarify. In future I will also publish my verion of a NR dashboard. Currently Im not fully happy with it.

[2021-12-02] (v2) First major upgrade. Things done are:
- Rewritten the functions itself. Better readable, more useful comments to help all users.
- Implemented 3 special functions in total now. **1**: WAR (weather dependent control) **2**: RTC (RoomTemperatureControled) and **3**: SoftStart function.
- Added good useful charts to each of the above three charts. But this can still use some more love.
- Improved on the stability of the control system. After reboot, things should continue now as they should. Making use of local storage and variables. 

[2021-12-04] (v3) Bug fixing
- Toggles on main page were not respected on other pages. 
- Setpoint sending to SET5 was needlessly being 'flooded' (every 10 seconds the same SP).

[2021-12-16] (v4) Things done are:
- Added scheduler. This is currently only for a DHW run or Sterilization run. Will expand this
- Added NR lib "moment" which is used in the scheduler.
- Added Energy charts (including COP calculation)
- General improvements

[2021-12-17] (v5) Things done are:
- Added the option to have a DHW threshold temperature above which the planned DHW run does not start
- Fixed import issues with non-heishamon sources. (Thank you @lampy25)
- Fixed hover-tip error in Function RTC tab (Thank you @lampy25)
- Improved visuals in Function RTC tab. (Thank you @lampy25 for your suggestion!)

- Improved import process further.

[2021-12-28] (v7.1) Things done are:
- BUG fix: Quiet Mode now really fixed
- Typo in threshold (thank you timovd!)

[2022-01-01] (v8) Things done are:

- Reduced excess SET commands to nearly zero (Thanks for the tip!)

[2022-05-29] (v14 beta9) Things done are:
- BUG: Fixed issue HeatPump being turned off when using the on/off temperature from RTC function
- BUG: Fixed issue where OperatingMode would not stick, also RTC function on/off related.
- removed bar-chart for COP. It keeps throwing errors or NaN value for DHW. Need to dive in at a later time.
- Solar function: for the time being use JavaBoon's code. Thank you !!!

[2022-05-29] (v14 beta10) Things done are:
- BUG: I forgot to enable the SET9 command again after some debugging. Re-enabled it.
- Feature request: Added a button on the request of klerk (and added some lines to make it look better)
- re-added bar-chart for COP. It seems to work. It should start building a chart once DHW + HEAT info is available. untill then it will be empty. Need time to test if this is solid or not.

[2022-05-31] (v14 beta11) Things done are:
- Improved reduction of SET messages even further. 
- FEATURE: Added a LOG page on the dashboard. 
- Added smoothening filter (moving average over last 15 minutes) to reduce frequent SP changes.

[2022-06-01] (v14 beta12) Things done are:
- BUG (critical): Oscillation behaviour (turn on/off heatpump) due to the RTC + Solar function not playing nice. https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/issues/29 

[2022-06-04] (v14 beta13) Things done are:
- Improved reduction of SET messages. Now also no messages after NR reboot. 
- BUG: Logs text color not being correct.
- Improved logs: Added toggle status changes to log 
- Removed smoothening filter again on room temperature (add it in personal area if you needed it.)

[2022-06-06] (v14 final) Things done are:
- Compared to 14beta13, Improved visuals in log page, increased amount of lines to 40.
- Compared to 14beta13, Improved chart storage.
- A lot: see details in above changelogs.

[2022-06-07] (v15) Things done are:
- Feature request: Compressor runtime added to home dashboard (https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/issues/28)
- Feature request: remove Fan 2 from home dashboard (https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/issues/28)
- Improvement: Logging - SOLAR function triggers and actions now loggged.

[2022-06-07] (v16) Things done are:
- Improvement: Logging - SOLAR function triggers and actions now loggged even better. In other section the logging has improved as well.
- Improvement: Reduce SET commands even further. Example, when due to RTC function the HP is off, but WAR function calculates a change in SetPoint. This setpoint is then NOT communicated to HP now. 
- Enhancement: Layout of the [Function Solar] has been improved with buttons which hide/show the chart/help section.
- BREAKING CHANGE !! : The connection node for P1 power meter has changed (simplified). This needs to be corrected manually after import of this version (16) or later.

[2022-06-26] (v17) Things done are:
- Improvement: ability to prioritize SOLAR function above all other functions with a toggle.
- little clean up. less mqtt messages being sent now.

[2022-06-27] (v17.1) Things done are:
- BUG: #35. Fixed error in degreedays calculation. it kept throwing an error. https://github.com/edterbak/NodeRed_Heishamon_control/issues/35

[2022-06-27] (v17.2) Things done are:
- Silly mistake corrected during export.

[2022-06-27] (v17.3) Things done are:
- BUG / Improvement: using custom temperature sensor for room / outside temperature. Now automatic.

[2022-07-07] (v17.4) Things done are:
- GUI: mostly layout improvements in solar function tab.

[2022-07-10] (v17.5) Things done are:
- BUG: Fixed a bug where the RTC function was not working correctly. Cause was linking to an incorrect variable.
- Enhancement: automatic detection of external sensor. For room temperature sensor and for outside temperature sensor.
</details><br/>


[2022-07-14] (v18.0) Things done are:
- BREAKING CHANGE (Solar function)! You need to reconnect and setup the P1 measurements to the flow in WP Solar tab. The correction ( x 1/-1 or x 1000/-1000 ) you put in, probably need to be adjusted. 
- BREAKING CHANGE (Solar function)! In the dashboard you need to setup the threshold and method again, even if they seem correct. Just reapply them. 
- The mentioned breaking changes are compared to v17.5 and earlier
- Enhancement: Solar function: a 3rd option as trigger is added. Now you can use Live value (kW) / kWh result of today / kWh exported. 
- Enhancement: HELP sections are added to for the most part. 
- Enhancement: Various tabs have layout improvements.
