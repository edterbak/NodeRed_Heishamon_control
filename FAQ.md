Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q - I use the Node Red Addon in Home Assistant, how to go to the Node Red Gui for editing?
<details>
    Most users should visit via a browser: 'http://Your_NodeRed_IP:1880/ui'<br/>
    In my case this wasn't working, perhabs due to the use of the DuckDNS addon. <br/>
    Use something like 'https://your.duckdns.org:1880/endpoint/ui/' instead.<br/>

Q - Can I use both WAR and RTC at the same time?
<details>
    Yes, the SP (Setpoint) will be adjusted depending on outside temperature and controlled by the settings in RTC
</details>

Q - If I switch off the Heatpomp via the Remote Controller will it disable the automation from the Node Red flow also?
<details>
    No, both will work seperatly. If you turn the Heatpump on via the Remote Controller, the pump will switch on.<br/>
    Keep in mind however that if the Node Red flow decides it time to adjust some settings it will act accordingly and overwrite settings.<br/>

Q - How do I add my Entities from Home Assistant like Livingroom temperature?
<details>
    In the Nope Red Gui (http://Your_NodeRed_IP:1880/ui) you will have to go to the [WP Control] tab;<br/>
    In the square "REQUIRED INPUTS FOR FUNCTIONS" you will have to add a node (left pane under Home Assistant) named "Events: state".<br/>
    You can drag and drop this in the square mentioned first.<br/>
    It will replace the "TOP33 - panasonic_heat_pump/main/Room_Thermostat_Temp"-node eventually, which you should disable if not using.<br/>
    Select the newly created node, then double click to open up the properties window;<br/>
    Give is a name of your choosings like 'LivingRoom_temperature'<br/>
    In the Entitie box you can try to find your sensor entitie (assuming you have already setup the MQTT settings earlier).<br/>
    Make sure that in the 'Output properties' you have a MSG.PAYLOAD = EVENT STATE<br/>
    Check the box 'output on connect' and make sure at the bottom this node is enabled.<br/>
    Finally press DONE to close the properties dialog and connect your node to the function node 'set.T_woonkamer_BT'<br/>

Q - How to update flow to latest version and keep my inputs, MQTT and Home Assistant settings?
 <details>
    Create a personal tab (WP Personal) and place your inputs here (P1, Temperature sensors)<br/>
    Give those inputs.sensors each an own [Link Out] node<br/>
    Connect those [Link Out] nodes to the already excisting [Link In] nodes by double clicking the [Link Out] node and select the corresponding one from the list.<br/>
